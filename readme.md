Bachelor Thesis of Oana Florescu, University of Bucharest

## Content

You can find here the notebooks that I used to prepare my bachelor thesis, the project consist in creating 4 models:

1. LSTM prediction model
2. Regression prediction model
3. SVM prediction model
3. Baseline predicion model

I use this four models to generate a trivial trading strategy and compare the absolute cumulative returns
